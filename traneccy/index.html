            <p>
so uhh i guess i was thinking along the lines of: hmm maybe i should do smthing for annecy. im not good at anything... but i did create this game website that i played on during class instead of paying attention. maybe i could add a page for her :mind-blown:

i decided to just make a mini-biography of myself since i figured that u wanted some more info on me. (and all the ohter options i came up with were way too time consuming... and im lazy)
